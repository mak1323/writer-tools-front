Welcome tot he front end of the writer tools. This is a tool set designed to help any aspiring writer to get the job done. Version 1.0 only includes the name generator, a helpful device for table top gamers and writers for a quick name for a restaurant, ship, baar, or even a quick password.

The eventual goal of this app is to build a comprehensive tool set for writers. Enjoy.

DESCRIPTION

I want to make a toolset for writers, gamers, and educators in order to help facilitate the creative process. The idea behind this project is to make this an ongoing piece. The first tool in this writer's toolbox is the name generator.

Have you ever been playing a game and sat there staring at a screen or character sheet thinking "What the hell should I name this?" Maybe it was a starship, a pirate ship, a bar, restaurant. Heck maybe you just couldn't think of a password? (https://xkcd.com/936/)

This is for naming ships, taverns, bars, etc. This follows the logic all great ships and bars follow a logic as follows:
The Millennium Falcon
The Barking Crab
The Black Dog
The Lost Fox
The Hairy Monk (This is a real place, look: https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/enhanced/webdr05/2013/8/5/12/enhanced-buzz-11133-1375719715-10.jpg?downsize=715:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto )
etc

So it follows this logic

“The”+ verb || adjective || adverb + Noun

So in theory I can make a database of each of these and then generate a random name according to the pulling of parameters from each.

USER STORIES
